![headshot in greenhouse][Greenhouse pic]


I am an NSF Graduate Research Fellow and PhD candidate in Dr. Lauren Hallett's lab at the University of Oregon. I am broadly interested in plant species interactions and the effects of global change on community coexistence. My research explores how invasive species and drought change coexistence in California grasslands and uses above and belowground functional traits to understand changes to coexistence patterns. I am passionate about using science to understand the effects of climate change on ecosystems and applying that knowledge to shape our stewardship of the environment we live in.
